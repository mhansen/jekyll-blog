By default, git doesn't use color. However, you can enable color for interactive use:

    $ git config --global --add color.ui true

This adds a line to your ~/.gitconfig file, enabling colors output for all
git operations on all repositories.

Awesome! Now `git-diff` will shine in radiant reds and greens, and it'll be 
oh so much easier to see what's changed. `git-branch` will show your current 
branch in green, `git-status` will show added files in green and deleted files
in red.

And git's smart enough to check if the output is going to the terminal
or to a pipe, where color codes could break things. Git only sends color
output to the terminal, where your eyes can enjoy it. I can't see any
reason *not* to enable color in git. Enjoy!
