Reading GEB today, I came across this nice definition of intelligence I had to
share:

>No one knows where the borderline between non-intelligent behaviour and
>intelligent behaviour lies; in fact, to suggest that a sharp borderline exists
>is probably silly. But essential abilities for intelligence are certainly:
> 
>- to respond to sitations very flexibly;
>- to take advantage of fortuitious circumstances;
>- to make sense out of ambiguous or contradictory messages;
>- to recognize the relative importance of different elements of a situation;
>- to find similarities between situations despite differences which may separate them;
>- to draw distinctions between situations despite similarities which may link them;
>- to synthesize new concepts by taking old concepts and putting them together in new ways;
>- to come up with idea which are novel.
