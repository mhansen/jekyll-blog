## How we made it
### The idea

## How it took off

### Sending it to news sources
- nzherald didn't care; they had their own. as did stuff
- tweeting at some people seemed to work, they liked it and retweeted it

### Sharing on facebook
- asking all my friends to share it (shameless marketing)
- lots of them didn't have to be asked

## Iterating
- adding a like button (we see there's 300 people liking it already)
- adding incomes
- adding analytics

### Traffic graphs
