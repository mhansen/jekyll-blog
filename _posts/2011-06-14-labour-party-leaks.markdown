\[**UPDATE 7:11pm**\]

I've talked to Boost, and they say they were not responsible for the
misconfigured servers. I've removed the post, because while the data breach was
egregious, the conclusions of the post were not correct - Boost was not
responsible.

Another party was responsible for the misconfiguration, and an investigation is
pending. They'll be calling me later in the week to let me know who was
responsible.
