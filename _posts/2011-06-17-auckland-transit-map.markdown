[Chris McDowall][chris] has made a wonderful visualisation of Auckland's
Transit data. He's taken the Google Transit Feed data from Maxx, and mashed it
up using Python/Matplotlib/Basemap/FFmpeg/Vimeo to deliver a 
[birds-eye view of Auckland's transit system over time][vis].

I'm keen to do something similar for Hamilton's transport network. Hamilton has
recently integrated their bus system with the [Google Transit Feed API][gtfa],
so I know there must be the data I need sitting publicly available on some web
server somewhere, in delicious plain CSV format. I'm just not sure where. I've
asked [Busit!][busit] if they can point me in the right direction, so watch
this space.

Chris has made a lot of other [excellent visualisations][chris], they're pretty
cool. [Check them out][chris].
