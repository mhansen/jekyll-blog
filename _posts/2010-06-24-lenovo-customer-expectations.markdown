description: Lenovo fails in many ways to deliver a good experience when I buy a new laptop

It was time to buy a new laptop, and apparently the Lenovo T510 was the
internet's linux laptop of choice. I tried to buy one from lenovo's website (I
haven't seen it in any shops in New Zealand), and it was a horrible experience.

Pricing
=======

Their pricing is ridiculous. Their site advertises a price, and a sale price.
Except the sale price is the everyday price, and it's about half the 'real'
price. 

When you have a 50% sale every day, it's no longer a sale.

Customising
===========

Customising the laptop was like stepping on a minefield. Every time you chose
an option, it would postback to the server, then *update the whole page* to
reflect the new price of your order, resetting any options that you've
chosen in the meantime. 

It's very annoying to have your options unset. 

The only way around this:
- wait a few seconds (for the postback to complete) between choosing each
  option. This got tedious fast when there's about 50 options, and I'm filling
  them in for the fifth time. click. wait... click. wait... click. wait...

- double-check each page before you submit to make sure it hasn't sneakily
  changed anything. 

God help you if a postback times out - the only thing you can do is start your
entire order from scratch. This happened so many times that I lost count.

The infuriating thing is - this postback crap isn't even necessary in the first
place!  This kind of simple addition/subtraction of prices and updating is what
client-side javascript was *made for*.

Delivery
======== 

Lenovo's site says my order 'Ships from plant within 8 days', and in fine print 
(so fine I totally missed it the first time through) 'Delivery after your order
has shipped from our plant will take approximately *4 (to metropolitan city
area) to 7 business days*'. 

Cool! I live in a metropolitan city area - I'll get my laptop in at most 8+4=12
days, right?

I'd finally jumped through all these hoops to buy the laptop, and they send me
an email. My order status is 'Submitted'. Submitted where? To who? To the
plant? To their website? What does 'Submitted' mean? Their website doesn't say.
I still don't know.

Five days later, I get the message that my order status has changed to
'Shipped'. Awesome! Four days after it's shipped, I'm waking up early so I
don't miss the courier. He doesn't come. The next day, I wake up early again.
I'm groggy, but excited. I'm getting a new laptop!  It doesn't come that day,
either.

I send lenovo an email, asking if there's a way to track orders. A track/trace
number, perhaps?

<blockquote>
Hi Mark

It's carried by DHL global forwarding, and they usually take about *7-9* days to make a delivery.
</blockquote>
(emphasis mine)

Oh. Your site said 4-7 days, but actually it's 7-9 days. *Awesome.* Why have I
been getting out of bed early?

Email
=====

All the status emails lenovo sent me came from a 
['no-reply' email address](http://blog.untrod.com/2009/08/do-not-reply.html).

<blockquote>
NOTE: Please do not respond to this message; it comes from a notification only address that cannot accept replies.
</blockquote>

There's no need to use a no-reply email in 2010. Route replies to support
channels. No-reply emails are just a barrier to supportting your customers.

Coupons
======= 

When I bought my laptop, there were a few coupons for $100 off available. I
tried them all, and found they only worked on the US website. Of course, there
was no indication of this, and when you enter them in the NZ site, all you get
is a generic error, no explanation that they only work in the US.

I tried going through the whole order process on their US site, waiting , entering

I went back to the lenovo website today, and I found there was a discount
coupon for New Zealand purchases this weekend - 20-30% off. I could have saved
$600 by waiting till the weekend? *ARRRRRRGH*

Conclusion
==========

I should have been happy - I was getting a new laptop! As a gadget lover, a
new laptop is one of the most exciting things.

But Lenovo still managed to disappoint, by setting high expectations,
delivering late, then pulling the price out form underneath me.

I've had better buying experiences with anonymous online auction websites.
