I'm interning at Google Sydney! 

I've just accepted their internship offer for three months over the summer.

My preparation for the interviews:

I checked out as many books as I could carry (go the uni library!). Books on
networks, algorithms, methodology, languages, parallel programming - anything I
could get my hands on.

In the interviews, we talked about designing for scale, languages, algorithms
(lots of algorithms) - all the juicy bits of Computer Science. We even did some
live coding via Google Docs. It was really challenging, and I'm lucky to have
got through.

I'm pretty excited. This is shaping up to be a great summer!
