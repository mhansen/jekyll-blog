Google freely provides some cool SEO information about your site:

- Top search queries leading to your site
- Links to your site
- Search engine keywords
- Subscriber stats
- HTML Suggestions (uninformative title tags, bad meta tags)

With this, I found that my post on the security of Hell Pizza's website ranks
#8 for queries for hellspizza.co.nz. Take *that*, Hell Pizza!

For these goodies, sign up for 
[Google Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/). It also
lets you 

- inform google of your 'preferred domain', which tells google to index my
  website as `http://markhansen.co.nz` instead of
  `http://www.markhansen.co.nz`.
- upload a sitemap listing the pages on your website - this was probably
  unnecessary for me (all my pages are accessible through 
  [the archives page](/archives.html), but it was so simple (they accept rss
  feeds as a sitemap) I did it anyway.

There's lots of other goodies that customise how your site is indexed. If you
run a website, you need to check it out.
