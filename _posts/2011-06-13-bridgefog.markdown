Lights have been attached to the Bridge St Bridge, and they look amazing in
Hamilton's signature thick fog. The fog's usually pretty thick, but it's even
thicker along the banks of the Waikato River, which these bridges cross.

I got a chance to snap some pictures of Bridge St bridge a few nights ago,
along with the Fairfield bridge and The Base.

Fog photos are a small obsession of mine. This time last year, I took some 
[fog photos of Waikato University](/fog/). Do you know any other areas in
Hamilton that are amazing in the fog?
