The people behind [Coverity](http://www.coverity.com),
a commercial static analysis bugfinding tool, have
[shared their experiences](http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/2/69354-a-few-billion-lines-of-code-later/fulltext/) in selling business software. It starts off a little slow, but it's a fascinating read, exposing many problems in the way software is developed. 

For example, managers who refuse upgrade to the latest version of the
bugfinding tool. That sounds like a no-brainer to me - get the latest version, 
and you get a better analysis of your code, you'll find more bugs that slipped
through last time, and be able to fix them before your customers find them. But
if you're a manager and your bonus depends on the bug number going down, the
last thing you want is a new version of the tool to push bug numbers back up.

> At company X, version 2.4 of the tool found approximately 2,400 errors, and
> over time the company fixed about 1,200 of them. Then it upgraded to version
> 3.6. Suddenly there were 3,600 errors. The manager was furious for two
> reasons: One, we "undid" all the work his people had done, and two, how could
> we have missed them the first time?

Clueless management incentives like this are part of the reason we can't have
nice things.
