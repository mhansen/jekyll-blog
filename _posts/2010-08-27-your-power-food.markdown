It's interesting to see what foods everybody thinks will help them concentrate
hardest.  I think a lot of people have their own special 'power food'

I saw this at a programming competition the other day. Competitors had to
concentrate intensely on problems for five hours, and they made sure they were
in the zone with their power food. 

I saw competitors with:

- Half a dozen packets of Oreos
- A Burger King combo ("we have it before every programming competition")
- [Tiny Teddy Biscuits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Teddy) ("they're awesome!")
- Massive bottles of Coke (of course)
- Tons of Fruit Burst lollies

In high school, I'd study for hours each night, fueled by Pams diet cola.

I've recently settled on half-diluted blue ("mountain blast") Powerade as my
power food. Just water isn't enough, and full-strength Powerade is too much,
but half-diluted is Just Right. 

I decided to jump in and learn Rails tonight - I'd need to concentrate for a
few hours without distractions. 

I mixed (to half strength!) 5 bottles I found lying around my room (I don't
have a problem!) with a massive can of powerade sugar. It's going great!

What's your power food? Would it be too much to call it an addiction?
