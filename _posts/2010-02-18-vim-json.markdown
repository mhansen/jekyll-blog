1. Download json.vim to `~/.vim/syntax/json.vim`  
2. Make a new file `~/.vim/ftdetect/json.vim` and write in it:

{% highlight vim %}
au BufRead,BufNewFile *.json set filetype=json
{% endhighlight %}

## How does this work?

1. When you put a file in `~/.vim/syntax/{name}.vim`, that syntax highlighting
   file will be loaded whenever the `filetype` variable is set to `{name}`.
2. The second step sets `filetype=json` whenever you load a file ending with
   `.json`, triggering the syntax highlighting.

[JSON.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1945) is a syntax
highlighter for [JSON](http://json.org) code, but the install instructions are
a little light on detail, and other

tell you to explicitly source
JSON.vim from some explicit path, which works for one computer, but won't if
you like to use your vimfiles in different directories on more than one
computer.
