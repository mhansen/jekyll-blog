I just don't see how this could get any better!

- Five awesome indie games including WORLD OF GOO(!!!)
- Pay *whatever you want* (really)
- No DRM
- Money goes to a charity of your choice
- Linux versions of all games

I happily paid $30, and put the money towards the Electronic Frontier
Foundation. They do great work fighting for your rights on the internet, and
I've been looking for an excuse to donate to them for a long time.

They have been 
[very transparent with their numbers](http://blog.wolfire.com/2010/05/Saving-a-penny----pirating-the-Humble-Indie-Bundle),
and it seems people are pirating the bundle. Literally, people are pirating
rather than paying a cent to charity. Gah!

It's not every day something this awesome comes along. There's 8 hours left on
the clock, go grab it!
