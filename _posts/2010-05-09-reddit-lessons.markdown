I learned a lot about building scalable websites reading 
[Steve Huffman's 'Lessons Learned at Reddit'](http://carsonified.com/blog/dev/steve-huffman-on-lessons-learned-at-reddit/).

I'm super grateful they provided a transcript of the video, because Flash sucks
big time on Linux. I tried to play it full screen, and the video would stutter,
even though it had already loaded. I can't wait for the native rendering speeds
promised by the `<video>` tag.
