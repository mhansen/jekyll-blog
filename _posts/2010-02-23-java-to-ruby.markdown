[10 Things Every Java Programmer Should Know About Ruby (2006)](http://onestepback.org/articles/10things/index.html), by Jim Weirich.

This is a *concise* guide to the major differences between Ruby and Java (or
java-like languages, e.g. C#). Reading it, I finally feel like I fully
understand mixins and messages. The real-life examples for everything helped a
lot.

I can recommend these slides for anyone coming from a Java or C# background who
wants to learn about Ruby.
